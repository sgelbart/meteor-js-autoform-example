# meteor-js-autoform-tutorial
Based on the project by Web Tempest - A Simple (In-Progress) Project Management Application

A simple example of how to use meteor autoform with collection 2

Link to tutorial http://www.webtempest.com/meteor-js-autoform-tutorial

Main change: I use "Items" instead of "Posts" for the main collection in the tutorial and I changed the field names.

**This "Advanced" branch goes beyond the tutorial to learn how to work with relationships and datatables**
